Switch Statements

Streamlined conditional to compare a single variable to a series of constants

make decisions based on enumerations

Characters conversation options based on their intelligence
You could use if else statemtents but they become combersome, if you start checking for more than 2 conditions, you want to use switch statements.

you have to start the command with "Switch" then followed by the integer.

then define a series of cases. include as many as needed

then create a jump statement by using "break" this will stop the code from going through the rest of the cases.

example switch

public class conversationscript : monobehaviour
{
public int Intelligence = 5;

void Greet ()
{
	switch (intelligence)
	{
	case 5;
		print ("super intel");
		break;
	case 4; 
		print ("great intel");
		break;
	case 3;
		print ("good intel");
		break:
	case 2;
		print ("ok intel");
		break;
	case 1; 
		print ("bad intel");
		break;
	default;
		print ("incorrect inteligence");
		break;
		}
	}
}
