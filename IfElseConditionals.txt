If and Else Statements

Codes that are based on conditions

for example, if coffee is too hot, you wont drink it

If the coffee is not to hot, then we drink it. 

Else statement would allow that if it was left out and got too cold, we wouldn't drink it either.

You can create an if statement for Coffee Tempurature is greater than the (Hot Limit) and have the Debug.log as "Coffee is too hot" and its "Dont Drink"

else, if you ahve hit the Cold limit you can create a Debug.log for "Coffee is too cold"

Else, if it doesn't meet either of those conditions, you can drink it.
